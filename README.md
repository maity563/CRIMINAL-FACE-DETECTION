# Face Recognition

A Java application for face recognition under expressions, occlusions and pose variations.

## Description:

- This is a prototype with the goal of improving recognition accuracy and reliability under un-cooperative scenarios like expressions, occlusions (obstacles like spectacles) and pose variations (<60deg).
- This project comprises eyewitness, investigator, and admin modules and needs you to create an effective image detection system. You will input sliced image data into the system and facilitate the instantaneous viewing feature on it.
